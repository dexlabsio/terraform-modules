# deX Public Terraform Modules

Welcome to the deX Public Terraform Modules repository! This repository
contains reusable Terraform modules designed to assist customers in
setting up dex-related resources on various cloud platforms. These
modules are aimed at simplifying the deployment process and ensuring
consistency across different cloud environments.
